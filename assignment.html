	  <p> I like this quote:</p>
	  <blockquote cite="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/tag/arts-and-humanities">
	  
	  The arts are not a way to make a living. They are a very human way of making life more bearable. <br>
	  Practicing an art, no matter how well or badly, is a way to make your soul grow, for heaven's sake.
